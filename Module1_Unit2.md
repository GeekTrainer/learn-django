## What is Django?

Django (pronounced "jango") is a free and open source framework that was first released in 2005 and was named after a famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. Over the years many Python frameworks have been developed, but Django has become one of the most popular because of its flexibility and security. It is suitable for both frontend and backend web development and the integrated Python libraries make it easy for rapid development. Django has become widely accepted across industries and because of its growing popularity, providers are more readily available to support Django applications on their platforms.

### Application types

Django offers a complete framework solution, which means it provides everything you need to quickly deploy your projects. Because Django offers great out of the box security, a vast community of users, and can scale on demand, this has become a framework of choice by most developers.  By using Django you have the ability to develop complex and database driven web applications that can include:
- Machine learning
- E-commerce platforms
- Data analysis
- Content Management

### Django vs Flask

While both of these frameworks could suit your needs for your next Python application, there are specific functionalities and levels of support that each provide. Let's quickly go through the differences.

Django
- Full-stack framework
- Ideal for complex data driven applications
- More of a learning curve
- Vast amount of users for support
- Out of the box security
- Numerous apps to help with your projects
- Suitable for development and production

Flask
- Lightweight web framework
- Great for smaller projects
- Bare bones framework so less of a learning curve 
- Uses Jinja2 as a templating language
- More control over elements within your application
- Suitable for development
        
As you can see Django and Flask each offer great benefits for your projects. When choosing the right framework, spending a little time to think about not only the type and complexity of the application but also the end product will save you time and frustration in the end.
