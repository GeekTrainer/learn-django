Now that Django is installed let's examine some key concepts and discover the difference between a project and an app. 


## Projects vs apps 

Project | App
--------|----------
There is only one project | There can be many apps within the single project 
Contains the necessary settings or apps for a specific website | Is a component of the larger website
Projects are not used in other projects | Apps can be used across multiple projects

## Views

Views are another component of Django apps that serve a specific function within the app. Views contain all the necessary code that will return a specific response when requested such as a template or an image. They can even redirect to another page if the request does not follow the necessary logic within the function.

## URL Mapping

URL mapping in Django is called `URLconf` and serves as a table of contents for your app. After a URL is requested this module will find the appropriate link within the project and redirect the request over to the views file contained within the app. The view will then process the request and perform the necessary operations.

As you continue to learn and have more complex file structures, you will add more views and URLs for your app. Through the use of `URLconf`s this function plays a key role as it allows for a simple way to manage and organize URLs within the application and provide greater freedom to change path roots without breaking the app.
