For this module in the learning path we will be going through the steps to install the Django framework, creating a Django project, and then finish by creating a **"Hello, world!"** app. This module covers all of the steps to create the project and app, but you do have the option to download the starter and solution files from GitHub. 

## Installing Git

In order to retrieve the files contained within GitHub we need to clone the repository. To begin the cloning process Git needs to first be installed on your computer. If Git isnâ€™t installed on your computer then go to the [Git website][1] to install the latest version. 

### Cloning the GitHub repository

Now that Git has been installed we can use it to [clone][2] the starter or solution files in the GitHub repository. To begin open a command prompt and navigate to the desired directory. Once in the directory start the cloning process by entering the following in the command prompt.

```bash
# [TODO] Needs final github link
git clone https://github.com/????
```
