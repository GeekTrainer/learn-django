For this module in the learning path we will be going through the steps to install the Django framework, creating a Django project, and then finish by creating a **"Hello, world!"** app. We have provided both the starting files, and the solution files for the app in GitHub. You have the option to either go through all of the steps to create the app file structure, or clone the starting file structure from GitHub. If you decide to clone the app file structure from the GitHub repository then follow the below steps after reaching **unit 6 - Creating Your First App**. 

## Installing Git

Now that our Django project is complete we need to retrieve the starter app for this module by cloning the GitHub repository. In order to clone the repository Git needs to be installed on your computer. If Git isnâ€™t installed on your computer then go to the [Git website][1] to install the latest version. 

## Cloning the GitHub repository

Now that Git has been installed we can use it to [clone][2] the GitHub repository. To begin open a command prompt and navigate to the previously created directory **myfirstproject**. Once in the directory start the cloning process by entering the following in the command prompt.

```bash
# [TODO] Needs final github link
git clone https://github.com/????
```
Once this has completed you should now see the **hello_world** app within the directory.
