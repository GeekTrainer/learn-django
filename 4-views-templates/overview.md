## Summary

As with every web framework, Django has a templating engine for creating dynamic HTML. The information the user wishes to access is created by this engine, and presented through views. We will explore how the engine works, and the process of creating views in Django.

## Learning objectives

1. Understand views
2. Understand templates

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Getting started with views | Understand views | Exercise | Understand views | yes |
| Getting started with templates | Understand templates | Exercise | Understand templates | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction to templates and views**

    Templates allow you to dynamically create HTML, while views are responsible for sending the appropriate template to the user. We will explore these core concepts.

2. **Exercise - Obtain the starter**

    To streamline this module, we provided a starter project you can use.

    1. Cloning the repository
    2. Installing the necessary libraries
    3. Open Visual Studio Code

3. **Getting started with views**

    Views are responsible for accepting a user request, loading the appropriate data, combining it with the appropriate template, and returning it to the user. We will explore how to create a view in Django.

    - Creating views
    - Routing in Django
    - Loading data
    - 404 errors

4. **Exercise - Creating views**

    We will create views to display the list of shelters in our database.

    - Creating views
    - Loading data
    - Registering views

    1. Creating views
    2. Creating routes
    3. Registering our routes in our project

5. **Getting started with Django templates**

    Templates act as the frame for the data and other information to be displayed to the user. We will see how we can use templates to dynamically create HTML.

    - Variables
    - Filters
    - Tags
    - Inheritance

6. **Exercise - Creating templates**

    Let's create templates for the views we created earlier.

    - Create templates
    - Display the pages

    1. Create the base template
    2. Create a list template
    3. Create a detail template
    4. Test the site

7.  **Summary**

    We explored how to create views and templates in Django.

8.  **Knowledge check**
