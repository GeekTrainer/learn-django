Now that the admin user has been created it is time for our first login to the Django admin interface. Since we already have our program running just go to your preferred browser and type the below URL.

    http://localhost:8000/admin

By entering this link it will direct you to the Django admin screen for login. 

Once you have successfully logged into the admin site you should see a screen that looks like below.

<img src="Module3_Images\Module3_DjangoAdmin.PNG" alt="SQLite Database Folder" style="margin-left: 30px;width:450px; height:auto" />

If you click on users you should now be able to see the new user that was just added.

![]("../Module3/Module3_Images/Module3_DjangoAdminSeeUsers")
