The Django platform was originally written in a newsroom environment where they needed content publishers to upload and approve content before being seen by the public eye. By creating an admin interface Django created a virtual wall that would only allow content to escape for public viewing if approved by the site administrators. This type of process is great for any application that needs to protect sensitive information or have site changes restricted for trusted users. Django has developed permissions that run based on the applications models, and while this interface is only intended for an internal tool and not an entire front end, it is still a great feature to get acquainted.
