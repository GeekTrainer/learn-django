Now that we have discovered and activated the Django admin site it has proven to be a very useful feature. It not only provides a very simple and convenient way to modify or add users but also change permissions within the application. While the admin site does not allow the adding or changing of field behaviors it does provide another way for trusted users to access the database and easily exchange information.

In this module you learned:
- How to add a superuser
- How to access the Django admin interface
- How to add app models and access data
- How to set user permissions

In the next module in this Learning Path we will start examining Django templates and how they are able to speed up development by dynamically generating HTML webpages.
