When creating applications you will eventually find yourself wanting to create individual permissions for site access. Creating an admin interface for employees or clients to manipulate content can be a cumbersome task. This is where Django has again come to the rescue and developed a simple admin feature that is automatically created in projects. We now continue our journey through the Django platform by activating the admin site, add user permissions and explore another view of the database.

In this module you will learn:
- How to enable the admin site
- How to create a super user
