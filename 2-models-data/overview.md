## Summary

Because Django is focused on data-driven applications it provides its own objection-relational mapper or ORM. We will explore ORM concepts, and how the Django ORM works. We will create our own models, and setup the database.

## Learning objectives

1. Understand the Django ORM
2. Create models for the Django ORM
3. Manage the database

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Getting started with the Django ORM | Understand the Django ORM | Exercise | Understand the Django ORM | yes |
| Create models for the Django ORM | Create models for the Django ORM | Exercise | Create models for the Django ORM | Yes |

| Working with migrations | Manage the database | Exercise | Manage the database | Understanding migrations |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction to the Django ORM**

    Because Django is designed to work with a database, it contains its own object-relational mapper, or ORM. We will see how to use the Django ORM.

1. **Exercise - Obtain the starter**

    To streamline this module, we provided a starter project you can use.

    1. Cloning the repository
    2. Installing the necessary libraries
    3. Open Visual Studio Code

1. **Exercise - Installing Django**

    We begin by installing Django locally.

    - Installing Django
    - Using a requirements.txt file

    1. Overview
    2. Create the project folder
    3. Create and activate virtual environment
    4. Install DJango

1. **Introducing the Django ORM**

    We explore the concepts of an ORM, and how the Django ORM works.

    - ORM concepts
    - Why use an ORM

1. **Models in Django**

    Models represent your data in an application. Models are also used by an ORM to interact with the database. We will explore how to create models in Django.

    - Model concepts
    - Creating models
    - Adding fields
    - Adding methods

1. **Exercise - Creating models**

    Let's see how to create models in the Django ORM.

    - Create models
    - Register them in Django

    1. Create models
    2. Register them in Django

1. **Managing the database**

    By creating our models we are also defining a database schema. Django can use this to then manage the database. We will explore the core concepts of working with the database through Django.

    - Understanding migrations
    - Creating migrations
    - Displaying the SQL
    - Running migrations

1. **Exercise - Creating the database schema**

    We see how to create a database using the Django utilities
    
    - Create migrations
    - Migrate the database to create it

    1. Create migrations
    2. Migrate the database
    3. Explore the created database

1. **Exercise - Working with data**

    The Django ORM allows us to use the models we created to interact with the data in our database. We explore how to create and retrieve data from a database in Azure.

    - Creating data
    - Retrieving data
    - Updating data

    1. Creating data
    2. Retrieving data
    3. Updating data

1. **Summary**

    We explored the core concepts of the Django ORM, which is used to work with data in Django.

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*

    - Multiple choice
