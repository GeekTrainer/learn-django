With the understanding of Django templates you now have the ability to create consistant pages and single points of modification with template inheritance while also developing dynamic pages with the tags and variables that are available within the templating language. By combining this with generic views it provides a simplistic way to display the contents of a database while allowing you to quickly move on to the next task.

In this module you learned:
- How to use template variables and tags
- How to add dynamic data to Django templates
- How to use template inheritance
- How to create different views to easily display data

In the next module in this Learning Path, you will begin learning about Django forms and how they can be used to capture user information or modify content within your application.
