 ## Exercise: Installing Django

While the Django framework may have a little bit of a learning curve, installing it is pretty simple with the steps below: 
1. The first step is to visit the Django website at this [link][3].
    - When viewing the Django website, you will have the choice to go through the tutorials and documentation, or just downloading the framework.
        * If you choose to read through some of documentation and tutorials then click [here][4]. This page gives you all the information you need to learn Django and also great ways to be a part of their community.
        * If you choose to just download the program then click the 'Download' button
            * You will then be given two options for the framework depending on which version you would like to use. For this lesson we are using the latest official version.
                * If you want to browse through the Django installation guide before downloading it can be found [here][1]. They also have a quick install guide that can be found [here][5].
                * Before downloading, also check that your Python version is the one that Django recommends. 
                    * If you do not have the recommended version of Python, then follow this [link][2] to the Python website to download the correct version.
                    
            [!NOTE] It is best practice to create virtual environments per project so as not to affect your other applications. Therefore, creating a virtual enviroment to hold your Django framework should also be considered before installing.
