Django (pronounced "jango") is a free and open source framework that was first released in 2005 and was named after a famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. Over the years many Python frameworks have been developed, but Django has become one of the most popular because of its flexibility and security. It is suitable for both frontend and backend web development and the integrated Python libraries make it easy for rapid development. Django has become widely accepted across industries and because of its growing popularity, providers are more readily available to support Django applications on their platforms.

## Application types

Django offers a complete framework solution, which means it provides everything you need to quickly deploy your projects. Because Django offers great out of the box security, a vast community of users, and can scale on demand it has become a framework of choice by most developers. By using Django you have the ability to develop complex and database driven web applications that can include:

- Machine learning
- E-commerce platforms
- Data analysis
- Content Management

## Django vs Flask

While both of these frameworks could suit the needs of your next Python application, there are specific functionalities and levels of support that each provide. Let's quickly go through the differences.

Django | Flask
-------|-------
Full-stack framework | Lightweight web framework
Ideal for data driven applications | Ideal for existing APIs and services
Potentially more of a learning curve | Potentially less of a learning curve
Out of the box security | Additional libraries needed for security
Custom HTML templating engine | Jinja HTML templating engine

As you can see Django and Flask each offer great benefits for your projects, but depending on the time requirements for app development one may be better suited then the other. When choosing the right framework, spending a little time to think about not only the type and complexity of the application but also the end product will save you time and frustration in the end.
