Views and paths (or routes) are core to any web framework, and are used to determine what information should be displayed to the user, and how the user will access it. Django uses these concepts as well.

## Paths

At their heart, all applications allow users to execute different methods or functions through certain mechanisms. This might be tapping on a button in a mobile application, or executing a command from the command-line.

In a web application, the user requests are made navigating to different URLs, by typing it in, clicking a link, tapping a button, or other means. A route tells Django if the user makes a request for a particular URL, or path, what function to execute.

A URL like **https://adventure-works.com/about** might execute a function called **about**, and **https://adventure-works.com/login** might execute a function called **authenticate**.

Paths in Django are registered by configuring `urlpatterns`. These patterns identify what Django should look for in the URL the user is requesting, and determine which function should handle the request. These patterns are collected into a module Django calls a `URLconf`

## Views

Views determine what information should be returned to the user. Views are functions or classes which execute code in response to the user request, and return back HTML or other types of responses (such as a 404 error).
