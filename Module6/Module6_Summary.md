We have finally come to the end of our learning path by completing a Django project, and successfully deploying it to the web by using Azure services. We only covered the surface of what Django can provide for Python projects, and hopefully you will continue exploring the Django framework. While Django may not be for everyone it certainly provides a complete framework to quickly deploy a Python app.

In this module you learned:
- How to connect the Azure remote repository to a local Git repository
- How to upload and deploy a Django project in Azure services
