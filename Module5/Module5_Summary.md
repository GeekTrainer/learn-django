In this module we learned how to implement Django forms and the different ways to speed up the form creation process by coding the forms in Python. Django has provided generic views for simple tasks, and a crispy tag to provide greater control in form layouts. 

In this module you learned:
- How to use the Django forms class to create fields
- How to create views to process a form request
- How to simplify forms with the **Crispy** library

In the next module in this Learning Path we will now take our completed app and upload it to Azure.
