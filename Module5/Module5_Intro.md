Most applications created today will involve some type of user input. In order to capture this input forms need to be created and displayed appropriately in the application. While some forms can be simple with just a few fields others can include numerous fields with complicated layouts and behaviors which can involve many hours of designing and testing. Django has streamlined this process by creating a forms class that allows forms to be created in Python and automatically create the HTML tags needed in templates. By using Django forms and gaining access to their form libraries cuts back on the time and effort involved with form creation.
